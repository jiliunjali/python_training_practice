    Python:
    Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language, which uses interpreter.
    It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation.
    It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.
    python was actually created earlier than Java, have become highly popular recently only.
    it is a programming language which is highly used nowadays in various fields, ranging from software development to field data science as well.
    We can talk about various things which make python so much popular nowadays :
    Design philosophy :
        Design philosophy can be referred as that thought process due to which some language is being designed or made .
        python language is one of the most easiest language to learn due to it's simpler syntax and writting style. it is very well indented and have a good appearance.
        due to all these reasons it becomes one of the most readable language.

    Batteries included :
        Python is said to be a language which have batteries included.
         it can be referred so , as python have various things in addition to it ,which is provided to its user or said a programmer .
         Like there are buildin functions, data types and functions and  operations which are associated with them by using which a programmer need not to write his own code for implementing the small functionalities.
         for example: in C / C++ to reverse a string , we need to write our own code using loops , but in python we are provided with a reverse(), which provides the same functioning without programmer needing to write his own code.
                      this helps programmer to focus on finding and  writing codes and logic for bigger application and programs rather than focusing on such small implementations.

    general purpose:
        Python supports lot of programming paradise which means that Python enables a programmer to use the concept of oops functional programming or a precision programming etc .
        Similarly via the use of python language we can make various types of softwares and applications and perform various types of task ranging from making a text up application to performing predictions.

    liberaries and Communities:
        python have extensive liberaries and big friendly community this in one of the biggest factor for why python is such a famous language.
